scripts/getAuthor.m: takes in article URLs and headlines, then writes author names into same sheet. You need the helper functions in the scripts folder and the list of common, multinational first names in the data folder. To improve future searches, continually add new names in 'names.xlsx' and remove unlikely/easily confused names ('Meta','Nan', etc). You can also add variations/translations of 'author' to Line 44 using Inspect feature in browser (ex. 'config_author'), and add specific replacements to Line 102.
