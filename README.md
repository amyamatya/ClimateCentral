scripts/getAuthor.m: takes in spreadsheet of article URLs and headlines, then writes author names into same spreadsheet. You need the helper functions in the scripts folder and the list of common, multinational first names in the data folder. To improve future searches, continually add new names in 'names.xlsx' and remove unlikely/easily confused names ('Meta','Nan', etc). You can also add variations/translations of 'author'/'written by' to Line 44 (use Inspect feature in browser), and add specific replacements to Line 102.
